# Lock Screen & Control Center Media Controls Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
This implementation adds full lock screen and control center media controls to the RBM Music app using `react-native-track-player` alongside the existing `expo-av` audio system.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### Lock Screen Controls
- ▶️ Play/Pause from lock screen
- ⏭️ Skip to next track
- ⏮️ Skip to previous track
- 🔍 Seek within track
- ⏹️ Stop playback
- 🎵 Track metadata display (title, artist, album, artwork)

### Control Center Integration
- Full media controls in iOS Control Center
- Track information display
- Album artwork display
- Background playback continuation

### Background Audio
- Seamless audio playback when app is backgrounded
- Audio continues during phone calls (with proper interruption handling)
- Audio continues when device is locked

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. TrackPlayerService (`src/services/TrackPlayerService.js`)
A comprehensive service that handles:
- TrackPlayer initialization with proper iOS/Android configuration
- Remote control event handling
- Metadata management for lock screen display
- Queue management
- Playback state synchronization

### 2. iOS Configuration Updates
**Info.plist** (`ios/Arbiem/Info.plist`):
```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>audio</string>
  <string>background-processing</string>
</array>
```

### 3. EAS Build Configuration
Updated `eas.json` to ensure proper build configuration for all environments.

### 4. Dual Audio System Architecture
The app now runs both `expo-av` and `react-native-track-player` in parallel:
- **expo-av**: Handles actual audio playback and app-internal controls
- **TrackPlayer**: Handles remote controls and metadata display

### 5. Synchronization System
A `syncAudioPlayers()` helper function ensures both systems stay in sync:
```javascript
const syncAudioPlayers = async (action, ...args) => {
  // Synchronizes play, pause, stop, and seek between both players
}
```

## 🎵 How It Works

### When a Song Starts:
1. `expo-av` loads and plays the audio file
2. `TrackPlayer` receives the same track metadata
3. Lock screen/control center displays track info and controls
4. Both players are kept in sync for state changes

### Remote Control Events:
1. User presses play/pause on lock screen
2. `TrackPlayer` receives the remote event
3. Event handler calls the appropriate app function
4. `expo-av` player responds to the control
5. Both players stay synchronized

### Metadata Updates:
1. When a new song loads, track info is sent to `TrackPlayer`
2. Lock screen automatically updates with:
   - Song title
   - Artist name
   - Album name
   - Album artwork
   - Playback progress

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### 1. Basic Playback Test
```bash
# Build and run the app
npx expo run:ios
```

1. Start playing any song in the app
2. Lock your device
3. Verify track info appears on lock screen
4. Test play/pause, skip controls

### 2. Background Playback Test
1. Start playing a song
2. Switch to another app or home screen
3. Audio should continue playing
4. Control center should show media controls

### 3. Control Center Test
1. Start playback
2. Swipe down from top-right (iOS) to open Control Center
3. Verify media controls are present and functional
4. Test all controls (play, pause, skip, seek)

### 4. Interruption Handling Test
1. Start playing music
2. Receive a phone call
3. Music should pause during call
4. Music should resume after call ends

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Development Build
```bash
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

### Production Build
```bash
eas build --profile production --platform ios
```

### Key Requirements:
- iOS 12.0+ (already configured)
- EAS Build (configured)
- Audio background capability (configured)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Lock Screen Not Showing Controls
1. Verify `UIBackgroundModes` includes `audio`
2. Check that TrackPlayer is properly initialized
3. Ensure track metadata is being set

### Remote Controls Not Working
1. Check console for TrackPlayer initialization errors
2. Verify remote event handlers are properly set
3. Test with a physical device (not simulator)

### Audio Not Playing in Background
1. Verify Audio mode is set correctly in `setupAudio()`
2. Check iOS background app refresh settings
3. Ensure app has audio permissions
